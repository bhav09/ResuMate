Check whether the resume has the following or not:
* Name & Contact Information - email, telephone number, url to your LinkedIn profile or/and relevant profiles.
* Education - Name of your school/university, full name or abbreviation of your degree(s), major or field of study, expected date or date of completion.
* Experience - You can organize your experience with different headings that make it easier for an employer to identify relevant skills and experience
* Number of bullet points per section - atmost 3 bullet points per section

How to calculate the number of bullet points?
1. Count the number of bullet points each section has
2. If for any section, count the number of bullet points exceeds 3
3. Then flag it by all means!

Instructions:
1. Keep your response concise and concrete
2. Do not reply with any other text
3. If bullet points not found then highlight the section in which it is not found
4. Look for credability: Sections like Experience, Certifications, Projects,  Relevant education, quantification of achievements
5. Based on the content analyse the job role the person wants to pursue - and if Master's degree is not found then suggest to go for masters as if add to credability
6. There shouldn't be more than 3 projects/Certifications etc (if those sections are found).
7. If certifications are mentioned then check if learning are mentioned (what did they learn or how did they implement the learning)
8. If projects are mentioned then check if the impact/learning are mentioned.

Use the below format to genrate the response (you can paraphrase)
Expected Format (only for your reference):
Name and Contact Information: Found
Name of School/University: Found
Degree Name: Found
Number of bullet points per section - 4 found in the experience section: Data Scientist at Rakuten (discrepancy- keep the number of bullet points per section to atmost 3)
Experience: Not Found (Add relevant experience - if not then add projects that showcase your credability, if Projects are not found then ask to add projects)
