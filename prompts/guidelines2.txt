Check whether the resume has the following or not:
• Check whether the resume is ATS compliant
• Bold section headings (e.g., Education, Experience)
• Consistent use of bold, italics, or underlining of body text
• Use bullet points to direct the reader’s attention
• Start each bullet point with action verbs

Remember:
0. If the sections don't have bullet points - then flag the section and respond
1. If sections with more than 3 bullet points - then flag the section and respond by all means!
2. If bullet points don't start with action verbs - then flag the section and respond by all means!

Instructions:
1. Keep your response concise and concrete
2. Do not reply with any other text
3. Only use the below format to genrate the response
4. Check formatting based on uniformity of resume (if it is multi column then ask them to change to more ATS compliant format)
5. If you mentioned "Not Found" for a criteria then justify why you have written it and clearly highlight the section in which it is not found

Use the below format to genrate the response (you can paraphrase)
Expected Output Format (only for your reference):
ATS Compliant: Not Found (Give in detail reasoning why it is not compliant)
Bold section headings: Found
Consistent use of bold, italics, or underlining of body text: Not Found (key achievements in the body of the experience section was not highlighted/bold/underlined)
Use bullet points to direct the reader’s attention: Not Found (The body of the resume was in paragraphs which is not very readable. To make the body of the resume readable - add bullet points)
Start each bullet point with action verbs: Not Found (certain bullet points in the experience section didn't start with an action word)
Formatting: Not Found (consists of multiple columns - it makes it difficult for the ATS to parse your resume correctly. Kindly follow a ATS compliant format)
