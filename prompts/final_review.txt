1. Study each review carefully and suggest the changes that are have discrepancies or are flagged as "Not Found" by all means!
2. Use your expertise to improve the resume by highlighting only the areas that need to be improved
3. Don't ask to remove contact information. Emphasize on fonts if comments found in reviews
